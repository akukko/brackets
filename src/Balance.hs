{-

Build a new list of matchups, and if the same team appears three times in a
row, add that matchup to buffer. At the beginning of each iteration, try to
empty the buffer. If the result is not three games for the same team in a 
row, add the first matchup in the buffer to the end of the matchup list.

Based on empiric research, this algorithm doesn't seem to get stuck in an
infinite loop. This has not been mathematically proven.
